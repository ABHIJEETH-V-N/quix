# QUIX 
<img src="icon.png">
## Inspiration

Modern UI design is everywhere, but gathering actionable feedback on specific interface elements is still clunky and slow. We wanted a tool that makes it effortless to collect targeted, visual feedback on any app or website UI—without the need for servers, accounts, or complex setup. QUIX was born to empower designers, developers, and teams to get quick, focused ratings on real UI screenshots, all in a beautiful, glassmorphic desktop app.

---

## What it does

QUIX lets you upload a screenshot of any UI, place rating points (hotspots) directly on the image, and instantly generate a shareable poll. End-users can rate each hotspot (1-5 stars) in a clean, browser-based preview—no sign-in or install required. QUIX also features a dashboard to view poll results, a polished dark/light mode, and a futuristic, glassy interface with Windows acrylic effects.

## How we built it

QUIX is built with:
- **Tauri** for secure, lightweight desktop packaging and native features
- **Vite + React.js** for a fast, modern frontend
- **AWS Lambda** integration for serverless poll deployment

---

## What we learned
- Deep integration of Tauri, Vite, and React for desktop apps
- The importance of user feedback in iteratively refining UI/UX
